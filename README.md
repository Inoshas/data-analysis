# Data-analysis
As part of a course exercise and to enhance my skills in data analysis using Jupyter Notebook and pandas, I recently worked with two separate CSV files obtained from Kaggle's diverse dataset collection. One file contains detailed data on housing in New York, while the other provides insights into Netflix's extensive content library and viewership trends.

Through this exercise, I aimed to sharpen my data analysis techniques by exploring these datasets. The NY-data set has been analyzed together with the course coordinator and some extra plots were added later on. Netflix data set was analyzed to find the relationships between data from the scratch. By delving into the intricacies of each dataset and applying various analytical tools and methods, I gained valuable hands-on experience in extracting meaningful insights from raw data.
